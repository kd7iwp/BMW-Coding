Create a .vmdk of a physical disk for VMWare
————————————————————
https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2097401

1.	If you are using a VMWare Workstation VM, rename the folder it is inside of to have “.vmwarevm” at the end as this makes it into a VMWare Fusion package
2.	Find the name of the disk
	diskutil list
3.	Find the positions of the partitions on the disk to grab the ones you need from the Nr column
	/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-rawdiskCreator print /dev/disk2
	Nr      Start       Size Type Id Sytem                   
	-- ---------- ---------- ---- -- ------------------------
	 5        126  117451089 BIOS 4D QNX4.x
	 7  117451278    6152832 BIOS 4D QNX4.x
	 9  123604173    3421782 BIOS 4D QNX4.x
	11  127026018    2297232 BIOS 4D QNX4.x
	13  129323313   26635707 BIOS 4D QNX4.x
	15  155959083     337302 BIOS 4D QNX4.x
4.	Create the .vmdk file. I tried using “fullDevice” rather than a comma-separated list of partitions numbers but it wasn’t working for me. Have it put directly inside the VMWare package
	/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk2 5,7,9,11,13,15 ~/Downloads/Neutrino641Target-2.vmwarevm/rawDiskFile ide
5.	This should create rawDiskFile.vmdk and for partitioned disks – rawDiskFile-pt.vmdk
6.	Add a few lines to the .vmx file inside the .vmwarevm Fusion package. Choose ide values not already in use, like ide0:1 or ide1:0 or ide1:1
	ide0:1.present = "TRUE"
	ide0:1.fileName = "rawDiskFile.vmdk"
	ide0:1.deviceType = "rawDisk"
	suspend.disabled = "TRUE"
7.	Now the drive should show up in the VM when you boot it 


Cloning a drive to an image and vice-versa
———————————————————

1.	In Terminal, run “diskutil list” to see the list of drives and find the external drive.
2.	If the disk is mounted, be sure to unmount it first, such as “diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2”
3.	Create a disk image from the external drive by typing “sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/Users/jonathan/Desktop/image.dd bs=512”
	You can choose other options instead of bs=512, such as bs=4096. Larger numbers copy much faster but the BMW CIC may not like block sizes larger than 512.
4.	To write back to the disk from an image run the same command but with the locations reversed for “if” (in file) and “of” (out file).
